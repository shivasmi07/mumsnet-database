# Business Intelligence Overview

### BI Components
- **Cube (.cube)** – defines measures, hierarchies, KPIs.  
- **Dimensions (.dim)** – define descriptive attributes (CustomerCity, Product, Date, etc.).  
- **Data Source View (.dsv)** – logical schema used in cube design.  
- **Partitions** – manage data loading and performance.

### Cube Design
- Fact Table: **OrderItem**  
- Dimension Tables: **CustomerCity, Product, Date**  
- Relationships modeled in a **star schema**.

### Dashboards
Power BI dashboards were built on top of the cube, enabling:  
- Sales trends over time  
- Cancellation rates  
- Regional drilldowns  

 See measures in [`bi-measures.md`](bi-measures.md).  
 See hierarchies in [`bi-hierarchies.md`](bi-hierarchies.md).
