# Problem Statement

The initial dataset contained three denormalized tables:

- **CustomerCity** – stored customer information with location details.  
- **Product** – stored product information including variants, size, color, etc.  
- **OrderItem** – stored items purchased by customers.  

### Issues in Original Design
- Redundant and repeated data across rows.  
- Partial dependencies within the Product table.  
- Risk of data inconsistency when updating records.  
- Difficulties in scaling queries for analytics and BI.  

### Goal
Normalize the database to eliminate redundancy, ensure data integrity, and make the schema suitable for transactional consistency as well as BI reporting.
