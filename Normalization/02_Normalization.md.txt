# Database Normalization (1NF → 3NF)

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each column contains **atomic values**.  
- Each column has a **unique name**.  
- Primary Keys identified:  
  - `CustomerCity` → **Id**  
  - `Product` → **ProductGroup + VariantCode** (composite)  
  - `OrderItem` → **OrderItemNumber**

**Status**: Tables already satisfied 1NF.

---

### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Must be in **1NF**.  
- No **partial dependency** (non-key attributes depend on full key).  
- `CustomerCity` and `OrderItem` were already in 2NF.  
- `Product` table had partial dependency → split into two tables:  
  1. **Variant** (VariantCode, ProductCode, Name, Cup, Size, LegLength, Colour, Price, Features, Description)  
  2. **VariantProductGroup** (VariantId, ProductGroup)

---

### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Must be in **2NF**.  
- No **transitive dependency** (non-key attributes depend only on primary key).  
- Surrogate key (`id`) added to `VariantProductGroup`.  

**Final Schema**: 9 normalized tables.
